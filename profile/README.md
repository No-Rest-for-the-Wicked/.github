### The Story

The year is **841**. **King Harol** is dead. Even worse, the **Pestilence**, an unholy plague not seen for a thousand years, has returned. It sweeps across the land, corrupting everything it touches.

**Madrigal Seline**, a ruthlessly ambitious figure in the church, sees the Pestilence as a chance to prove herself in the eyes of her god. These forces converge on the backwater **Isola Sacra**, where rebel groups and the provincial government fight for control amid the isleâ€™s crumbling ruins.

You are a **Cerim** â€“ a member of a group of mystical holy warriors imbued with remarkable powers and sworn to defeat the Pestilence at any cost. But the task will prove increasingly challenging as you become entangled in the peopleâ€™s plight and the vast political struggle of this downtrodden land. Chaos will pull you in every direction as you seek to cleanse the land of the plague and shape the kingdomâ€™s fate.
